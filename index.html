  <h3 class="centre">ABOUT</h3>
  <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="http://physics.otago.ac.nz/research/kjaergaardlab/">Light and Matter Lab</a>, at the University of Otago, with a background in software and electronics engineering, especially towards scientific instrumentation. I am based in Dunedin, New Zealand</p>
  <h3 class="centre">PROJECTS</h3>
  <p>RI have developed a monitoring system for our laboratory. A pre-print of a paper descibing our situation can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12589">the arXiv</a>, and the source code and documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/mchilcott/lab-monitor/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find some graphs I have put together on the early days of NZ's COVID19 situation <a href="https://mchilcott.github.io/TrackingCOVID19/">here</a>. These are entirely for my own interest, and relate only really towards New Zealand's situation. There are also some notes on basic SIR(D) type models that are used for predicting epidemic spread.</p>
  <p>Various other projects from the lab can be found <a href="https://github.com/kjaergaard-lab">on GitHub</a>.</p>
