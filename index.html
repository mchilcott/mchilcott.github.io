  <h3 class="centre">ABOUT</h3>
  <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://physics.otago.ac.nz/research/kjaergaardlab/">Light and Matter Lab</a>, at the University of Otago, with a background in software and electronics engineering, especially towards scientific instrumentation. I am based in Dunedin, New Zealand</p>
  <h3 class="centre">PROJECTS</h3>
  <p>Recently, I have been developing a monitoring system for our laboratory. A pre-print of a paper descibing our situation can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12589">the arXiv</a>, and the source code and documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/mchilcott/lab-monitor/">here</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find some graphs I have put together on the COVID19 situation <a href="https://mchilcott.github.io/TrackingCOVID19/">here</a>. These are entirely for my own interest, and relate mostly towards New Zealand's situation. There are also some notes on basic SIR(D) type models that are used for predicting epidemic spread. I have not attempted to do much in the way of predicition, but have a small exploration.</p>
  <p>Various other projects from the lab can be found <a href="https://github.com/kjaergaard-lab">on GitHub</a>.</p>
